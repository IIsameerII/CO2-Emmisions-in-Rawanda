st.write('With a primary focus on greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). These emissions result from a variety of human activities, including the use of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, manufacturing, and deforestation. Rising global temperatures, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, the melting of the polar ice caps, an increase in sea level, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity are some of the negative repercussions that follow. To ensure a healthy and habitable planet for both the present and future generations, addressing the emissions problem is a global necessity that requires cooperative efforts to reduce and ultimately eradicate these harmful emissions.')
